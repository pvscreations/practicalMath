# Practical Math

Practical Math is a JavaScript package designed to provide fundamental mathematical functions essential for development. Tailored to include statistical functions and cover various aspects of school mathematics, this package emerged from the practical needs encountered while working with TensorFlow models and rule-based classifications.

## Features

- **Basic Mathematical Functions:** Covering essential operations for numerical computations.
- **Statistical Functions:** Including functions for statistical analysis and data processing.
- **School Mathematics Support:** Offering functionalities aligned with school-level mathematical concepts.

## Motivation

The inspiration for creating Practical Math arose during the development of TensorFlow models and rule-based classification systems. As the need for reliable and efficient mathematical operations became apparent, the Practical Math package was conceived to address these requirements.

# Usage

### 1. Approach 
To effortlessly incorporate the practicalmath into your project, follow these simple steps:
#### Importing ####
```
import { PracticalMath } from 'practicalmath';
PracticalMath.euclideanDistance({ point1: {x:1,y:2,z:3}, point2: {x:3,y:4,z:2} });

```
# 2.Available Functions
##### * findBestFitLine
